	Jeremy would like a downloadable CSV file to be generated which conveys this data

9: The lifecycle for an advert is:
	Submitted -> Approved -> Withdrawn or Expired
10: A mailing list should be generated highlighting newly published events to students. All
	SE/ESE students are enrolled automatically. This can only be opted out of if they have secured
	a suitable placement.
