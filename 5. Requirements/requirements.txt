Submission of internship advertisements
Companies will have direct access to the system via a login
The login will be distributed by the course coordinator to the company
Companies receive login credentials from .. (not specified - the system probably).
The advert submission screen should be a structured template. It should be like a web form with fields to fill in. He envisages a table of skills that advertisers can select as required or desired -- possibly via check boxes
Would like the system to warn the advertiser if they leave the start date out or don’t give a clear indication
Normally for the established companies, a link to the application page of the company should be included in the description

The company can choose to use the system to collect applications from students or use their own system
Companies post ads with structured templates, that need to be approved by the coordinator before becoming public. 
Ads are posted via the system (not by email) eg - webform. The form should have a table of tickable skills that the company can select what it is looking for.
There should be warning about not completed fields, but there shouldn't be required fields (obviously some essential things will need to be required).
Companies can post links to more info in the ad.


Review, comment and publication of internship advertisements by the course coordinator
When an internship advertisement is approved, an email is sent to the student
The adverts will be left up and not taken down




Review of advertisements by students
The student only applies through the system if the company (usually small company) requests them to do so. These companies normally only take 1 or 2 students tops.
Some placements come from e-Placements and Club 21 and are re-advertised. The advert normally links the student back to where it was originally advertised.
Some adverts/applications are still handled by Club 21 and e-Placements
If the student needs to upload their CV to apply to a small company that uses the system to handle applications, they upload a base copy and are allowed to edit it to tailor it to the company they are applying for.
When a new advert is published, an email is sent to the student 
The system will not allow students to comment on adverts

Students can apply either through the company's system, by redirect from the ad, or through the system, if the company doesn't have/want to use their own system.

Students should be able to upload their CVs and cover letters, but should also be able to change them prior to applying to individual placements. (Either by editing through the system or re-uploading ?)

Students should be able to receive emails for new posted ads.
Students shouldn't be able to comment to adds. (An answer wasn't given for 'vote-type' review - eg 5 star)

Students are supposed to notify the coordinator once they secure the placement, via the system.
If the ad was approved by the coordinator as being SE compliant, the placement should be auto-approved once the student informs the coordinator.

Once a placement is secured, the ad should remain in the system.
The ad should be readvertised by the company if needed. We don't need to bother with making the ad available once the placement 'goes bad'.

SE students should be preinrolled in the system.


Notification of successful selection for an internship by an SE/ESE student
Students notify of success in gaining an offer for an internship through the system
If a student notifies of success in gaining an offer from one of the advertised companies on the system, then this is automatically approved.
The criteria of the notification the student gives: pay, how long, description of job and what you are doing (must be substantially SE/ESE based, depending on course). If the description involves Requirements Engineering and not actually coding, then this still counts as SE.

For placements secured through other means (not the system), the student needs to inform the coordinator by giving a brief description of the placement. The placement needs to satisfy basic SE placement requirements - 10+ wk,  �250+, substantially SE.

Non-functional
New students/companies should be able to apply for accounts. These need to be approved by a coordinator. Once they're approved, emails with user/password should be sent tho the applicants.
There should be a single interface, but different dashboards available to the user type once the user logs in.
The system should have a single point of entry for all users but should have different dashboard for different types of users after they log in.
The system should automatically enroll SE/ESE students to the system with a login. Other users will have to register to use the system.
Getting login details to the company could be done by email -- an email could be sent to the company with registration details and the course coordinator would approve the request for the company to be part of the system. 
The system should ideally have no manuals/online help features/tutorials. It should be easy enough to use that it doesn’t require it.
