\section{Test Execution}
Where possible tests  should be implemented using the JUnit test framework. Tests which must be performed manually should be clearly marked in the corresponding 
acceptance test report.\\
Naturally there may be some omissions in the test inputs laid out here, particularly if the provided implementation requires any non standard setup or does not conform to the domain model provided. If this is the case, any additions to the inputs should be well documented in the acceptance test report.
