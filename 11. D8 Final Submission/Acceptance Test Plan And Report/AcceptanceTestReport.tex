\section{Summary of Acceptance Testing}
All tests were carried out using the JUnit test framework on a pre-written test harness. This was modified to make test cases more complete and to accommodate the ability to add users/adverts, etc. using the methods provided by Team K. Each test was run multiple times on a `fresh' instance of the InternMan implementation provided to ensure the accuracy of results.\\

As can be plainly seen, a large number of tests have failed. In general however, most of these stem from two issues:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Failure to implement a coordinator.}
\item{Failure to limit effective permissions of the various categories of user.}
\end{enumerate}
To expand the second point, all tests in which a user should be denied access to a certain piece of information failed by the user being granted access. This could suggest that logging in has no effect on what data can or can not be accessed at any time. Further testing and code inspection would be required to prove this theory.\\
Naturally, the implementation and testing of these features should be a priority in future development iterations.\\
