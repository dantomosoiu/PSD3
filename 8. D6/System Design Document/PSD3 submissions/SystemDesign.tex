% This is a template for constructing your project plan document, but
% also to show the use of the l3deliverable class. Use pdflatex and
% bibtex to process the file, creating a PDF file as output (there is
% no need to use dvips when using pdflatex).
%
% Several meta data commands have been implemented to collect
% information such as deliverable identifier, project name etc (see
% below the \date command.

\documentclass{l3deliverable}

% You can use the svn-multi package to automatically insert version
% control information into your document (an example of how to do this
% is shown below).  Make sure to set the 'svn:keywords' subversion
% property to 'Id' for the source file, for example, type:
%
% svn propset svn:keywords 'Id' d1.tex
%
% in the same directory as your 'd2.tex' file. 
%
% The information between the two $$ will now be updated when you next
% commit the file to your SVN repository.
%
% You can of course, just use this field to insert manual version
% information, e.g. 1.2, 1.2.1 ... instead.

\section{System Overview}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{ComponentDiagram.png}
\\
The proposed system consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
\item{InternMan: This component contains an implementation of the InternMan facade provided and can be seen as the 'main' component for the system. }
\item{User Factory: Provides methods for creating new users of different types, storing created users and fetching users from this store. This component also provides
services for authenticating a user's login credentials using a stored username/password combination.}
\item{Offer Management: Handles offers made to students.}
\item{Advert Management/Store: This component provides the necessary services to create and view adverts, associated these with an employer account, etc. It simultaneously
manages the storage and retrieval of adverts from an appropriate source.}
\item{Placement Store: Provides services for manipulating internships and associating these with an approriate role.}
\end{itemize}

%%%%User factory
\subsection{User Factory}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.35]{UserFactoryComponent.png}
\subsubsection{Description and Rationale}
There is a need to create many different categories of user in the system who share attributes and methods. For example all users must be able to log in using a method
to authenticate an input password. In this situation it is appropriate to employ the factory design pattern for the creation of generic users, visitors, students and employers.
The coordinator is not instantiated by a factory, but instead is implemented according to the singleton design pattern. \\
UserStoreImpl groups the methods of these factories and entities together to provide methods for creating and fetching each class of user. For the moment the exact 
means by which these users will be stored has not been decided, but this should also be handled by UserStoreImpl. The method set for UserStoreImpl is equivalent to the API for 
the UserFactory component.
