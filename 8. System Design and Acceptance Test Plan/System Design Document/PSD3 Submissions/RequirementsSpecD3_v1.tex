\section{Introduction}
Software Engineering (SE) and Electronic and Software Engineering (ESE) students in the School
of Computing Science are required to complete an internship as part of their course, in the summer
between level 3 and level 4. An internship is a short period of time that a student spends working
within in a company in order to gain experience (from as little as a month up to a year). Internships
in the software industry are normally paid, although the rate offered can vary from company to
company. The School imposes requirements on these internships to ensure that the student receives
an appropriate experience for their degree programme. More details of these restrictions can be found
on the Software Engineering Summer Placement (SESP) moodle page.\\
\\
Currently, available internships are advertised to students on an ad-hoc basis through the SESP
moodle page. An organisation wishing to recruit an intern submits an advertisement to the course
coordinator, who publishes it on the course mailing list. The format and content of the advert can
vary widely, including information about the nature of the internship (what the successful applicant
will do), duration, expected start date, compensation, person requirements and so on. The course
coordinator checks each advert and comments on whether it is suitable for SE/ESE students, as students 
who are not enrolled on the SE/ESE scheme may also view the advertisements posted on
the SESP moodle page in order to obtain information about possible internships.\\
\\
Sometimes internships applications are managed through the Careers Service's Club21 website;
sometimes through the e-Placements scheme; and sometimes the company has its own system of
collecting applications. In addition, some advertisements are posted by academics in the school for
students to work with them during the summer vacation.\\
\\
The allocation of SE/ESE students to internships is tracked by the course coordinator separately,
using a Microsoft Access Database. Students are required to inform the coordinator when they have
secured a placement, which may or may not have been advertised on the SESP page. The coordinator
must then approve the internship if it is suitable for the student's course.\\
\\
The SESP course coordinator has decided that a unified system is necessary for collecting and
publishing internship advertisements, and for tracking which SE/ESE students have been successful
in securing them. An initial requirements analysis has found that the following features must be
supported by the system:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Submission of internship advertisements}
\item{Review, comment and publication of internship advertisements by the course coordinator}
\item{Review of advertisements by students}
\item{Notification of successful selection for an internship by an SE/ESE student}
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Related Documentation}
These documents are available in our team repository:
\begin{itemize}
	\item{Client interview questions}
	\item{Raw requirements list}
	\item{Interview audio recording}
	\item{Client consent form}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Purpose and Description of Document}
This document displays the use cases we have identified for the system. The long term aim of the document is to add to it as new requirements are identified and to use it as a basis for system design. 

\subsection{Document Status and Schedule}
Naturally this document is under constant revision as new requirements are identified and as stakeholder conflicts are resolved\\
\\
This document should be revised weekly in time for the next PSD team meeting (Tuesday 11am), assuming any changes are required. A change log for this document is visible in the Appendix. Further information about changes can be viewed using github's version tracking features.

\section{System Scope}
As specified in the initial business case, the system is only to be used within the Department of Computing Science. The only outside interaction comes from companies who submit advertisements to the system. \\
The process of a student applying for a placement is the most complex with regards to scope. In many cases larger companies will have their own websites or online application processes which they will wish the student to take part in. In this case the student does not apply through the system and will apply by using the details found in the corresponding advert for the placement. However smaller, independent companies may not have their own process. For such companies the system will handle direct applications by the student to the company. Finally the student may also find placements entirely on their own. When this occurs the student should submit information about the placement through the system, but the application to the placement is outside the system scope.\\

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{System Actors}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{Actors.pdf}

The above diagram shows the actor roles present in the system:
\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Student:}\ all students enrolled in the system who can apply for placements. This can be further broken down into CS, SE and ESE students, who will have
different rules on what constitutes a suitable placement.}
\item{\textbf{Coordinator: }\ the course coordinator will have privileges to approve and reject files, view student progress, etc.}
\item{\textbf{Organisation: }\ any group who advertises placements to the system. This may include external companies, internship schemes and university groups.}
\end{itemize}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\subsection{Domain Model}
\includegraphics[scale=0.45]{domain_model_v2.pdf}\\
Unauthenticated users represents the guests that visit the system, prior to logging in.\\\
Unauthenticated users can opt to sign up, which creates a PendingAccount instance, that needs to be approved by a Coordinator. Once the Coordinator approves it, the PendingAccount becomes one of the three types of Account, and can then be used for logging in.\\

Account is a generalisation representing user accounts. This branches off to three types of account - Organisation, Coordinator and Student.\\

Organisations represent either Companies or Academics (distinguished by type). They create AdvertisedPlacements that, once approved by a Coordinator, become visible on the AdvertBoard.\\

Students are either ordinary Computing Science students, in which case they can only view adverts, or (Electronic) Software Engineering students, which can also apply to the placements that are visible on the Advert Board.\\

Students can secure placements, either from the ones visible on the AdvertBoard, or from external sources. Coordinators need to approve the securing of placements.

\begin{itemize}
\item{\textbf{Utilities / Account Management}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Login}
		\item{Account creation}
	\end{itemize}}
\item{\textbf{Coordinator Administration}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Advert approval}
		\item{Mark placements as filled}
	\end{itemize}}
\item{\textbf{Advert Submission}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Submission of adverts by organisations}
		\item{Submission of external placements by students}
	\end{itemize}}
\item{\textbf{Advert viewing and applications}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{Viewing of adverts}
		\item{Application for placement through system}
		\item{Notification of successfully securing a placement}

\section{Non Functional Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item{When the deadline for a placement has been reached, the placement should remain visible for one week after the deadline before being removed from the advert board}
\item{There should be a single interface, but different dashboards available to the user type once the user logs in.}
\item{Getting login details to the company could be done by email -- an email could be sent to the company with registration details and the course coordinator would approve the request for the company to be part of the system.}

\section{Conflicts and Resolution}
\textbf{Conflict}: Originally in client interview it was established that students could be able to make applications through the system directly to companies. However at the stakeholder panel it was suggested that this feature was outside of the system's scope.
\textbf{Resolution - \date{2012/11/08}}: The question of whether this feature should or should not be implemented was raised by the team in the Requirements Forum. compromise the team chose to keep this feature as a potential use case but relegated it from a must have to a could have status.\\
