% This is a template for constructing your project plan document, but
% also to show the use of the l3deliverable class. Use pdflatex and
% bibtex to process the file, creating a PDF file as output (there is
% no need to use dvips when using pdflatex).
%
% Several meta data commands have been implemented to collect
% information such as deliverable identifier, project name etc (see
% below the \date command.

% You can use the svn-multi package to automatically insert version
% control information into your document (an example of how to do this
% is shown below).  Make sure to set the 'svn:keywords' subversion
% property to 'Id' for the source file, for example, type:
%
% svn propset svn:keywords 'Id' d1.tex
%
% in the same directory as your 'd2.tex' file. 
%
% The information between the two $$ will now be updated when you next
% commit the file to your SVN repository.
%
% You can of course, just use this field to insert manual version
% information, e.g. 1.2, 1.2.1 ... instead.

\section{System Overview}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{ComponentDiagram.png}\\
The proposed system consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
\item{InternMan: This component contains an implementation of the InternMan facade provided and can be seen as the 'main' component for the system. }
\item{User Factory: Provides methods for creating new users of different types, storing created users and fetching users from this store. This component also provides
services for authenticating a user's login credentials using a stored username/password combination.}
\item{Offer Management: Handles offers made to students.}
\item{Advert Management/Store: This component provides the necessary services to create and view adverts, associated these with an employer account, etc. It simultaneously
manages the storage and retrieval of adverts from an appropriate source.}
\item{Placement Store: Provides services for manipulating internships and associating these with an approriate role.}
\end{itemize}

\section{Component Breakdown}

%%%%User factory
\subsection{User Factory}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.35]{UserFactoryComponent.png}
\subsubsection{Description and Rationale}
There is a need to create many different categories of user in the system who share attributes and methods. For example all users must be able to log in using a method
to authenticate an input password. In this situation it is appropriate to employ the factory design pattern for the creation of generic users, visitors, students and employers.
The coordinator is not instantiated by a factory, but instead is implemented according to the singleton design pattern. \\
UserStoreImpl groups the methods of these factories and entities together to provide methods for creating and fetching each class of user. For the moment the exact 
means by which these users will be stored has not been decided, but this should also be handled by UserStoreImpl. The method set for UserStoreImpl is equivalent to the API for 
the UserFactory component.
\subsubsection{API}
UserStoreImpl implements UserStore

\textbf{Methods}\\
%addUser
\textbf{public void addUser(String surname, String forename, String GUID, String password)}\\
Adds a new user to the store.\\
\textbf{Parameters}\\
String surname\\
String forename\\
String GUID\\
String password\\
\\
%addVisitor
\textbf{public void addVisitor(String surname,String forename,String GUID, String password)}\\
Adds a new visitor to the store\\
\textbf{Parameters}\\
String surname\\
String forename\\
String GUID\\
String password\\
\\
%addStudent
\textbf{public void addStudent(String surname,String forename,String GUID, String password,String matriculation,String programme)}\\
Adds a new student to the store\\
\textbf{Parameters}\\
String surname\\
String forename\\
String GUID\\
String password\\
String matricaulation\\
String programme\\
\\
%addEmployer
\textbf{public void addEmployer(String name, String contact, String password)}\\
Adds a new employer to the store\\
\textbf{Parameters}\\
String name\\
String contact\\
String password\\
\\
%addCoordinator
\textbf{public boolean addCoordinator(String surname, String forename, String GUID, String password)}\\
If one does not exist, a new coordinator is added and true is returned. Else false is returned.
\textbf{Parameters}\\
String surname\\
String forename\\
String GUID\\
String password\\
\\
%getUser
\textbf{public User getUser(String GUID, String password)}\\
Returns a user specified by the GUID, if authentication is successful.\\
\textbf{Return} the user specified by GUID, if the password is a match\\
\textbf{Parameters}\\
String GUID\\
String password\\
\\
%getVisitor
\textbf{public Visitor getVisitor(String GUID, String password)}\\
Returns a visitor specified by the GUID, if authentication is successful.\\
\textbf{Return} the visitor specified by GUID, if the password is a match\\
\textbf{Parameters}\\
String GUID\\
String password\\
\\
%getStudent
\textbf{public Student getVisitor(String GUID, String password)}\\
Returns a Student specified by the GUID, if authentication is successful.\\
\textbf{Return} the student specified by GUID, if the password is a match\\
\textbf{Parameters}\\
String GUID\\
String password\\
\\
%getEmployer
\textbf{public Visitor getVisitor(String contact, String password)}\\
Returns a visitor specified by the contact if authentication is successful.\\
\textbf{Return} the user specified by contact, if the password is a match\\
\textbf{Parameters}\\
String contact\\
String password\\
\\
%%%%%OfferManager
\subsection{Offer Management}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{OfferManagement.png}
\subsubsection{Description and Rationale}
This component is needed to allow students to notify the course coordinator that they have accepted an internship. If the internship was advertised in the internship management system, then it is automatically approved. Otherwise, the student can create a new self-sourced role which will send an email to the course coordinator asking for approval. Approval is done through this component.
\subsubsection{API}
OfferMangementImpl implements OfferManagement\\
\textbf{Methods}\\
%addUser
\textbf{public void notifyAcceptedOffer(Role role, String managerName, String managerEmail)}\\
Sends email to coordinator informing that a student has accepted an internship\\
\textbf{Parameters}\\
Role role\\
String managerName\\
String managerEmail\\
\\
\textbf{public void approveAcceptedOffer(String matriculation)}\\
Sends email to coordinator informing that a student has accepted an internship\\
\textbf{Parameters}\\
String matriculation\\
\\
\textbf{public Role createNewSelfSourcedRole(String title, String location, Data start, Date end, String description, Double salary)}\\
Sends email to coordinator informing that a student has accepted an internship\\
\textbf{Return}\\
Returns the newly created self-sourced role\\
\textbf{Parameters}\\
String title\\
String location\\
Data start\\
Date end\\
String description\\
Double salary\\
\\

%%%%%Advert Management/Store
\subsection{Advert Management/Store}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.5]{adStore.png}

\subsubsection{Description and Rationale}
Advert Management/Store is needed to handle creation, selection and publishing of all advertisements within the system. It interacts with other components which need information on adverts through the selectAdvertisement method which provides a handle on an advert with a supplied index.
\subsubsection{API}
TODO

%%%%%Placement Store
\subsection{Placement Store}
\includegraphics[scale = 0.4]{ClassDiagram_PlacementStore.png}

Prints out all existing placements.\\
\\

\textbf{Return: }Placement with identification number id removed if successful , otherwise null.\\
\textbf{Parameters}\\
int id\\
