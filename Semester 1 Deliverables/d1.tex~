% This is a template for constructing your project plan document, but
% also to show the use of the l3deliverable class. Use pdflatex and
% bibtex to process the file, creating a PDF file as output (there is
% no need to use dvips when using pdflatex).
%
% Several meta data commands have been implemented to collect
% information such as deliverable identifier, project name etc (see
% below the \date command.

% You can use the svn-multi package to automatically insert version
% control information into your document (an example of how to do this
% is shown below).  Make sure to set the 'svn:keywords' subversion
% property to 'Id' for the source file, for example, type:
%
% svn propset svn:keywords 'Id' d1.tex
%
% in the same directory as your 'd2.tex' file. 
%
% The information between the two $$ will now be updated when you next
% commit the file to your SVN repository.
%
% You can of course, just use this field to insert manual version
% information, e.g. 1.2, 1.2.1 ... instead.

\subsection{Purpose and Description of Document}
This document describes the Organisation and Responsibility designation within our team. Team members individual duties are listed, assuring the workload is split evenly. To extend on this methods of communication and decision making are recorded.

By agreeing on the spread of responsibility before the project commences we can avoid disagreements at a later, more time-sensitive point. We can also attempt to see flaws in our management system. By finding these now, the issues can be closer watched to prevent serious problems occuring.
